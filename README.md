# QSPARSE Examples

This repository contains following examples for QSPARSE, which are also the codebase for the experiments in [Training Deep Neural Networks with Joint Quantization and Pruning of Weights and Activations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08271). 


| Code | Description|
|---|--|
| [cifar10](cifar10/) | Image classification with MobileNetV2 on CIFAR10. |
| [espcn-sr](espcn-sr/) | Super resolution with ESPCN on 91Image and Set5. |
| [fasterrcnn](fasterrcnn/) | Object detection with Faster RCNN using ResNet101 on Pascal VOC. | 
| [cyclegan_pix2pix](cyclegan_pix2pix/) | Image-to-image translation with two generative adversarial networks (GANs): Pix2Pix and CycleGAN trained on facades and horse2zebra, respectively. |

Feel free to raise an [issue](https://github.com/mlzxy/qsparse-examples/issues/new) if you encounter any problems.
